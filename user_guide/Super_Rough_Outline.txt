Neptune User Guide 
Diode ladder filter based on the one from Moritz Klein.

Overview
Neptune is a diode ladder filter.
Two inputs into the same filter core
LP Input is low pass
	Volume control over LP Input
HP Input is high pass
	Volume control over HP Input
Cutoff controls the frequency of the filter
Resonance controls the emphasis at the cutoff frequency
Salt is a feedback circuit that can introduce some chaos to the filter

Resonance balance with input volume
This filter does not attenuate the volume of the input when the resonance is turned up
This results in a tradeoff where the resonance sounds more sweet and sing songy when the input volume is lower.
More volume = less strong resonance

Details:
Cutoff
	Controls the cutoff frequency of the filter
	Left LEDs indicates opening of low pass filter
	right LEDs indicates opening of high pass filter
	Cuts audio off completely from both inputs, can be used as a spectral crossfader this way

Resonance:
	Controls the volume increase at the cutoff frequency
	Talk about how the filter is like a spring, wanting to return to center, and it moves more freely near the center.	
		More input volume = less obvious resonance
	Red LED indicates self oscillation
	Marking indicates self oscillation point
	you can keep turning it up to get more harsh self oscillation
	
Salt:
	Controls a feedback circuit that introduces a bit of grit, and chaotic instability
	The affect of salt is strongly intertwined with resonance, the higher resonance, the more unstable the salt is.
	
LP Vol:
	marking indicates unity gain
	Input volume and resonance are a balance, more volume means less resonance
	For a "sweet" resonance turn to around 12 o'clock

HP Vol:
	marking indicates unity gain
	FInput volume and resonance are a balance, more volume means less resonance
	For a "sweet" resonance turn to around 12 o'clock
	
FM1:
	Attenuverter controlling the cutoff frequency
	Blue LEDs are positive modulation
	Red LEDs are Negative modulation
	Marking indicates zero modulation

FM2:
	Attenuator for cutoff frequency
	marking indicates rough v/oct key tracking
