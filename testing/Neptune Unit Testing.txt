Neptune Unit Testing

LP test: Goal: Make sure low pass filter can fully cutoff input audio, as well leave it unaffected on the other side
	Input 20 hz square
	Knob/CV fully positive should leave input unaffected
	Knob/CV fully left should output less than 500mV (might want to change this threshold, whatever silence means to you)
		
HP test: Goal: Make sure high pass filter can fully cutoff input audio, as well leave it unaffected on the other side
	Input 20kHz sine (we could also change this to a slower square wave and use the fast rising edges as the high frequency information)
	Knob/CV fully negative should leave input unaffected
	Knob/CV fully positive should output less than 500mV (might want to change this threshold, whatever silence means to you)
		
Resonance/self oscillation:  Goal: Make sure the filter starts self oscillating at the correct point, and the filter cutoff knob is properly centered around 1khz
	Self Oscillation should start at ~4.3v at the resonance CV input
	Knob 12 o'clock self oscillation 1khz +- TDB hz
	Knob fully left self oscillation 4hz +- TDB hz
		
Instability: Goal: Make sure the instability circuit is functioning (what does functional instability mean really?)

FM1: Goal: Make sure FM1 attenuverter is working to control cutoff frequency
		
Output VCA: Goal: Make sure the output VCA is working to control output volume
