Neptune Prototype Testing/changes

Test all inputs and outputs for +- 12v

LP:
	test general functionality of LP input volume DONE
	
HP:
	test general functionality of HP input volume DONE

Cutoff:
	Test general functionality of cutoff knob control DONE
	Test that the CV range and the knob range are the same

Resonance/self oscillation:
	Test general functionality of resonance knob control DONE
	Test that the CV range and the knob range are the same
	Does the first half of the resonance knob travel seem not particularly effective?
	Self Oscillation LED comes on too early and too gradually
		Adding transistor circuit to make this led pop on when self oscillation starts DONE ON SCHEMATIC
	The pitch of the self oscillating wave is quite rough
		Potential causes:
			low tolerance 1nf caps used in prototype
			Resonance VCA output is low voltage, making op amp drift potentially a factor
				Changing two resistors and adding two resistors to the resonance VCA output to increase the voltage of the op amp output. DONE ON SCHEMATIC
		
Instability:
	Test general functionality of instability knob control DONE
	Test that the CV range and the knob range are the same
	Remove solder jumpers 
	
Output VCA
 	Test general functionality of output VCA DONE
	Test that the default output volume is the same as +5v into the volume input
		
VREF:
	get rid of C205 decoupling cap?
	
FM1:
	Test general functionality of FM2 knob control DONE
	Currently the knob is a bit sensitive (hard to dial in 0 modulation) and the LEDS aren't very sensitive.
		Adding 4 resistors and moving a couple diodes around to increase deadzone of knob and led sensitivity DONE ON SCHEMATIC

FM2:
	Test general functionality of FM2 knob control DONE
